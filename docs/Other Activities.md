## Outreach and Volunteering Initiatives:

In addition to my research in condensed matter physics, I am deeply committed to outreach and community engagement. I volunteer with Science for All, an organization dedicated to promoting STEM education in underrepresented communities. As part of this initiative, I lead workshops at local high schools, where I introduce students to the fascinating world of physics through hands-on experiments and interactive demonstrations. This experience has not only enhanced my communication skills but has also ignited a passion in students to explore science further.

## Student Group Involvement:

I am an active member of the Graduate Student Physics Society (GSPS) at McGill University, where I serve as the Outreach Coordinator. In this role, I organize events such as the annual Physics Carnival, which invites families from the community to engage in fun physics-related activities. This event aims to foster interest in science among young children and their parents. Additionally, I facilitate seminars and discussion panels that address current topics in physics, providing a platform for graduate students to share their research with a broader audience.

## Mentorship Programs:

Recognizing the importance of mentorship in academic success, I participate in the Peer Mentorship Program for first-year graduate students. I guide new students through their transition to graduate life, offering support in academic challenges and providing insights into managing research and coursework. My mentorship extends beyond academic advice; I encourage my mentees to get involved in outreach efforts and student groups, emphasizing the value of community engagement.
