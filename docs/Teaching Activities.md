## PHYS 232 HEATS AND WAVES

(JANURAY 2024 - APRIL 2024)


Course description: Free, driven, and damped harmonic oscillators. Coupled systems and normal modes. Fourier methods. Wave motion and dispersion. The wave equation. The laws of thermodynamics and their consequences. Thermodynamics of P-V-T systems and simple heat engines.

The course will include the following topics:

Periodic motion (including harmonic oscillators)
Corrections to periodic motion (including friction)
Coupled oscillators
Continuous systems (including oscillations in a string)
Waves (including phonons)
Heat (including fluctuations and heat baths)
Entropy (including the second law)
Temperature (including its definition)
Heat transport (including Fourierâ€™s law and non-Fourier heat transport)
PV diagrams (including energy transferred thermally)
Degradation of Energy (including Carnot cycles and heat engines)

Professor: Michael Hilke
