I am a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Physics at McGill University, Montreal. I have completed my undergraduate Physics Honours from the University of Delhi, India. As a theoretical physicist specializing in Condensed Matter Physics, I work as a Research Assistant in Dr. Nikolas Provatas's research group. </p> <p>I am passionate about learning and constantly eager to explore new things. I am currently working on my research project focused on the Structural Phase Field Crystal (XPFC) Vapor Model for binary alloys. Currently, I am learning how to make the phase diagrams for simple PFC and XPFC models for Pure materials and understanding the mechanism behind the Rapid solidifications. Working theoretically and making numerical simulations of such models has not only allowed me to deep delve into the world of Phase Field Crystal modeling but also helped me understand the real-world context of solids and liquids and their behavior at different conditions which works practically at industries. This practical insight has been invaluable. I am looking forward to work and get some real time results for my Research\u00a0Project.</p> <p>Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have a creative side that finds expression through photography, capturing the world\u2019s beauty one frame at a time. I love traveling and exploring different places. </p>"},{"location":"Other%20Activities/","title":"Other Activities","text":""},{"location":"Other%20Activities/#outreach-and-volunteering-initiatives","title":"Outreach and Volunteering Initiatives:","text":"<p>In addition to my research in condensed matter physics, I am deeply committed to outreach and community engagement. I volunteer with Science for All, an organization dedicated to promoting STEM education in underrepresented communities. As part of this initiative, I lead workshops at local high schools, where I introduce students to the fascinating world of physics through hands-on experiments and interactive demonstrations. This experience has not only enhanced my communication skills but has also ignited a passion in students to explore science further.</p>"},{"location":"Other%20Activities/#student-group-involvement","title":"Student Group Involvement:","text":"<p>I am an active member of the Graduate Student Physics Society (GSPS) at McGill University, where I serve as the Outreach Coordinator. In this role, I organize events such as the annual Physics Carnival, which invites families from the community to engage in fun physics-related activities. This event aims to foster interest in science among young children and their parents. Additionally, I facilitate seminars and discussion panels that address current topics in physics, providing a platform for graduate students to share their research with a broader audience.</p>"},{"location":"Other%20Activities/#mentorship-programs","title":"Mentorship Programs:","text":"<p>Recognizing the importance of mentorship in academic success, I participate in the Peer Mentorship Program for first-year graduate students. I guide new students through their transition to graduate life, offering support in academic challenges and providing insights into managing research and coursework. My mentorship extends beyond academic advice; I encourage my mentees to get involved in outreach efforts and student groups, emphasizing the value of community engagement.</p>"},{"location":"Relevant%20Links/","title":"Relevant Links","text":""},{"location":"Relevant%20Links/#relevant-research-papers","title":"Relevant Research Papers","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Computational Material Science Group, Professor Nikolas Provatas.</p> </li> <li> <p>Orientation gradients in rapidly solidified pure aluminum thin films: comparison of experiments and phase-field crystal simulations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Phase-field crystal model for materials with anomalous expansion during solidification and its application to the cavitation of supercooled water droplets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Solute-induced transition in Poisson's ratio and strength: A phenomenon in additively manufactured Al-Si-Mg alloys.</p> </li> <li> <p>Investigating gas-phase defect formation in late-stage solidification using a novel phase-field crystal alloy model.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consistent representation of vapor phases in phase field crystal dynamics.</p> </li> <li> <p>Investigating gas-phase defect formation in late-stage solidification using a novel phase-field crystal alloy model.</p> </li> <li> <p>OpenPFC: an open-source framework for high performance 3D phase field crystal simulations.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Research%20Activities/","title":"Research Activities","text":""},{"location":"Research%20Activities/#aim","title":"AIM","text":"<p>\u201cRapid Solidification of two component alloy (AlCu) using the Phase Field Crystal model to investigate the formation of dislocations and the subsequent precipitate formation in the rapid 3D Laser printing in additive manufacturing.\u201d</p> <p>The aim of my research project is to study rapid solidification of a two-component Al-Cu alloy solidification using compuational simulations using a recently published OpenPFC al gorithm for efficient 3D simulations of the phase field crystal model (PFC). Phase field crystal (PFC) is a hybrid atomic-continuum technique that captures atomic resolution information of crystalline matter while operating on diffusive time scales. The new OpenPFC modeling platform will be used to go beyond what has been done in previous work for the study of rapid solidification in pure (single species) materials. I will investigate the production of dis locations at a fluctuating interfaces and inter-phase boundaries during rapid solidification of an Al-Cu alloy, and concurrent or subsequent precipitation of a solid-state phase at or near the cores of dislocations and other defects.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Teaching%20Activities/","title":"Teaching Activities","text":""},{"location":"Teaching%20Activities/#phys-232-heats-and-waves","title":"PHYS 232 HEATS AND WAVES","text":"<p>(JANURAY 2024 - APRIL 2024)</p> <p>Course description: Free, driven, and damped harmonic oscillators.
